# Green Day Backing Track
Aiming to create a quick and easy way to listen to any combination of instrument-tracks of available Green Day songs via web-browser.

Utilizes PHP to minimize the amount of code necessary to allow all of the various songs and their instrumental tracks to be played. Initially each album and song required their own pages with heaps of repeated code to run the audio for each mutli-track file however with the implementation of PHP, all of the songs can be navigated and played via just 3 very small web pages.

## DISCLAIMER
This repository does NOT contain the actual instrumental files due to the files exceeding the limit of GitHub repositories. I hope to eventually get a live version of the repository hosted in the future.
